"Kaggle Challenge Analysis: Space Titanic"

This project is dedicated to exploring, analyzing, and visualizing the Space Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The main goal is to uncover insights from the training and test datasets, with an emphasis on understanding passenger demographics, survival rates, and other key factors. The analysis utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Numpy for numerical calculations, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.

To run this analysis, you'll need Python and several libraries installed on your system.

Clone the repository: git clone (https://github.com/ResearchMethodsGroupAssignment/Kaggle_Challenge_Team2.git)

Install required libraries: pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib

Features

Data Loading: Demonstrates how to load datasets from remote sources.
Data Exploration: Provides an initial look at the data, including basic statistics and information.
Visualization: Utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib for generating insightful visualizations of the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Prepares raw data for further analysis and modeling by cleaning, transforming, and encoding it to enhance data quality and efficiency.
